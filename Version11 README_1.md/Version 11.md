# Welcome to Version 11 ReadMe.

# Version 11 was released in February 2025.

Our Team wanted to leave next iterators with some information that we hope can help guide you throughtout working on Svelvet's Codebase. We Thank You for your Contribution.

Firstly, there is little documentation to help guide an interator on Svelvet. Svelvet is built on Svelte, a library similar to React. Our Team spent some time getting acquainted with Svelte first and then migrated into the codebase. We were nervous at first but you will find once you're in the code and navigating around, you will learn.

In navigating the Codebase, and upon rendering the application in the browser, the initial Canvas did not support the creation of nodes. Pressing 'D' on the keyboard generates the DrawerControl component that other groups included but its functionality needed debugging.

We spent alot of time trying to debug this Controller functionality within the main canvas but eventually decided recreate the main Canvas.

You are now able to create nodes and edges(refer to Graphstore readme in this folder). While the customization of the nodes backgrounds or any personalization is not doable, you are able to create nodes and their edge connection.

Uniquely, we later found that in the routes folder, there are a variety of routes there that you can visit in the browser at those specific endpoints, you will be able to see various Svelvet Features. This is something we recently found and wanted to share.

Additionally, we visited previous Versions of Svelvet. We looked at the commit histories from Svelvet(730+ commits) and found teh ones closely related to each version. I have attached the Commit SSHs for your reference. We ran:

- For Version 9
  " git checkout 7ba45fdb4bfd349b4f536f61156ff66c76542f8a"

- For Version 8
  "git checkout 377c65b519777d73b06cf8ccd0f6f527818dc906"

Overall, working with Svelvet was definitely an education journey.
Diving into an unknown Codebase can seem intimidating at first but Remember "Progress is Progress no matter how small". I wouldn't consider anything a failure.

Feel free to navigate the remaining files in this Version 11 ReadMe folder to better learn about my team's contributions.

Goodluck and Best Wishes.
Team Svelvet 11 @February 2025.
